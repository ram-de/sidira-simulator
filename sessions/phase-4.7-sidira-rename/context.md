# Session: phase-4.7-sidira-rename -- pre-launch product rename

## Goal
Rename Pythia to Sidira before public launch, starting with the user-visible simulator product surface and then progressing through config, package names, docs, cross-repo producers, and domain/project metadata.

## In Progress
- [ ] None. #111 is merged; next pickup is #113 or #112.

## Completed
- Created and pushed the Phase 4.7 session file on `main` (`85b8dcf`).
- Moved #111 to In Progress in the GitHub Project.
- Created feature branch `codex/111-sidira-product-surface`.
- Audited active product-surface references. #111 should touch visible frontend copy and FastAPI display metadata, not package/env/repo names.
- Added RED/GREEN backend smoke coverage for Sidira OpenAPI display metadata.
- Implemented #111 visible product-surface rename in frontend app metadata, nav, home page, simulations list copy, product placeholder copy, and FastAPI display metadata.
- Verification passed: backend full suite (`350 passed, 10 skipped`), frontend `npm run typecheck`, `git diff --check`, and live HTTP smoke for home/simulations/product/OpenAPI output.
- Code commit: `0c0f9b0 feat: rename product surface to Sidira`.
- Rebased code commit after session save: `0ce0b63 feat: rename product surface to Sidira`.
- Codex review clear: no discrete correctness issue introduced by the diff.
- PR opened: #116 (`https://github.com/ram-de/pythia-simulator/pull/116`).
- PR #116 squash-merged to `main` as `fb620a1` (`feat: rename product surface to Sidira (#116)`).
- #111 closed as completed and Project status verified as Done.

## Next Steps
1. Pick up #113 (public config/env and external labels) if the next goal is production readiness without code package churn.
2. Pick up #112 (package/module/import rename) if the next goal is deeper code identity cleanup.
3. Keep #115 (domain/project/repo metadata) for the last coordination pass after package/config decisions settle.

## Key Files
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` -- app metadata title/description.
- `frontend/components/TopNav.tsx` -- visible product brand in app chrome.
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` -- homepage hero and active product copy.
- `frontend/app/simulations/**` -- simulation wizard/list/result surfaces.
- `backend/pythia_simulator/main.py` -- FastAPI display metadata only, if touched.

## Key Context
- Phase 4.7 plan: #110.
- First execution ticket: #111.
- Product is pre-public, so deeper rename is appropriate for later tickets, but #111 stays scoped to active product surface and display metadata only.
- Historical session logs should not be bulk rewritten. Remaining `Pythia` references under `sessions/**` are archive context unless a specific active session file needs a note.
- Canonical brand: Sidira. Canonical domain: sidira.ai.
- Remaining #111-scope `rg "Pythia|pythia|PYTHIA" frontend/app frontend/components backend/pythia_simulator/main.py` hits are intentionally not changed in this ticket: `pythia_simulator` import path, `PYTHIA_CORS_ORIGINS`, and `pythia.*` browser draft-storage keys.
- PR #116 shipped the visible product surface only. Package/module/env/repo names remain intentionally tracked by #112/#113/#115.

## For my cofounder
Session opened 2026-05-28. #111 is merged. The session remains active for Phase 4.7; next recommended pickup is #113 for outward-facing config labels, then #112 for package/module/import rename after the external surface is stable.
